  <br /><br /><strong>SERVERLESS TRADER</strong>
</h1>


This project can be a starting point to build a scalable, cost-efficient (low-cost) crypto trading bot using 100% serverless components on AWS. It provides the building blocks to: 
- Interact with the Binance exchange using the CCXT library
- Call external services such as Coingecko to gather crypto prices
- Enable Persistence (bot state, trading session state, orders status)
- Bot Event Logging
- Dynamic Configuration parameters
- Technical indicators 
- Example trading strategy which implements basic concepts

To get started, please read the [Documentation Repository](https://github.com/serverless-trader/documentation)
